# [Kaggle-Bike-Sharing](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand)
This is an ongoing project on Kaggle Bike Sharing problem. I explopre the data, preprocess, visualize, analyze and an try different linear and nonlinear regression models and compare their performance on the data set. Each section is treated in a separate ipython notebook for ease of review.

### 01 - Kaggle - bike share system -  Problem formulation
Description of the problem, the data set (features, targets) and discussion of the evaluation metric.

### 02 - Kaggle - bike share system - Data preprocessing
Using pandas' time series capabilities, we extract numerical values of date (year, month, day) and time (hour) from the `datetime` column. Also, we make one additional data set where the categorical data are represented by dummy matrices.
